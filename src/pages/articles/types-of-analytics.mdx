**Data Analytics:** The process of studying data in detail, then dividing it into subcomponents, and analyzing the subcomponents individually and their relationship to one another is called data analytics. Descriptive, Prescriptive, and Predictive analytics are the various techniques and methodologies to extract information and make informed decisions based on data.

**Why study data:** For evidence-based decision-making, problem-solving, performance optimization, insights, innovation, research, and understanding the world around us, studying data is important. It enables us to make informed choices, generate new knowledge, and drive positive outcomes in various domains.

**Various analytics techniques:**

**Descriptive analytics:**

Descriptive analytics plays a vital role in comprehending past events by condensing and presenting historical data in a meaningful manner. It aids in generating valuable insights for planning purposes by identifying ongoing trends through concise data summaries. This process encompasses techniques such as data aggregation, summarization, and visualization to offer a comprehensive overview of historical trends and patterns. Descriptive analytics addresses the fundamental questions of “what” and “how” to provide a clear understanding of the past.

For instance, when the business or brand owner examines the sales data from the previous year to extract insights regarding profit trends and sales patterns, with a specific focus on variations across seasons, months, and weeks. This analytics helps in analyzing this historical data, they aim to gain a comprehensive understanding of how sales and profitability fluctuated throughout the year and how different time periods contributed to overall performance.

**Predictive analytics:**

Predictive analytics assists in forecasting future outcomes by leveraging historical data and statistical models. It entails examining past data, detecting patterns, relationships, and trends, and employing statistical and machine learning methodologies to construct predictive models for projecting future events or behaviors. This analytics centers around addressing the “what if” question, enabling stakeholders to anticipate potential scenarios and make informed decisions based on the projected outcomes.

To illustrate this better, considering stock market fluctuation involves utilizing historical data, statistical methods, and machine learning techniques to forecast and anticipate future changes in stock prices. By examining patterns, trends, and relevant indicators, predictive analytics aims to provide insights into potential market movements.

**Prescriptive analytics:**

Prescriptive analytics aids in offering recommendations and solutions to accomplish a defined objective, rather than solely focusing on predicting future outcomes. It generates actionable insights and guidance by integrating historical data, predictive models, and optimization techniques. This form of analytics centers around determining the optimal course of action based on a thorough examination of data, models, and the relevant business context. Prescriptive analytics addresses the question of “what should be done,” providing concrete recommendations for decision-making and strategic planning.

For instance, determining the optimal pricing approach that will yield the highest possible profit by considering various factors such as market demand, competitor pricing, customer preferences, and cost structures. This analytics aims to identify the most profitable pricing strategy that strikes a balance between attracting customers and maximizing revenue while taking into account the store’s unique characteristics and market conditions.

**General Observation:**

- All three types of analytics rely on historical data to varying extents.

- They involve extracting insights from data and using it to inform decision-making.

- They often require the use of statistical and analytical techniques to analyze data.

Therefore, the profound impact of data analytics techniques on business strategies and the attainment of rewards cannot be overstated. With their remarkable versatility spanning diverse industries, these techniques empower organizations to make data-driven decisions and forge strategic plans with confidence and precision. By harnessing the power of data analytics, organizations can fortify their operations and unlock the full potential of their endeavors, ultimately optimizing outcomes and propelling success to new heights.
