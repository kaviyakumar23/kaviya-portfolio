Business intelligence tools are beautiful because they can expose hidden trends and patterns that could go overlooked when only looking at raw data. This is due to the fact that visual information is generally processed more effectively by our brains. Data analysts and laypeople alike may find business intelligence to be a useful tool for simplifying complex information.
